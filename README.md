# DummerGoki / DGoki moveset
My self coded moveset.<br>
It tries to be advanced while also not removing things like BLJs. (so you can speedrun with it, etc.)<br>
I was going to keep this private, however many people asked me to release it.<br>

## KEEP IN MIND:
This moveset is kinda goofy and has things that don't look right.<br>
These things are intended and will not be fixed, since i find them funny.<br>
For example: Spamming dive and slide-kicks on slopes rapidly causes you to climb them easily.<br>

## Here a list what the moveset does:
+ Ground pound jump. (A HOLD OR PRESS)
+ Slide kick on dive. (A PRESS)
+ Allows to go up on slopes easier.
+ Allows you to dive on a ground pound to cancel it. (B PRESS)
+ Allows you to slide kick on a long jump. (A PRESS WHILE NOT HOLDING Z)
+ Allows you to dive on a long jump. (B PRESS)
+ Adds a quadruple jump that causes you to twirl. (A PRESS)
+ Increases movement speed by like 35% (not accurate since sm64 physics are weird.)
+ Other small changes.
